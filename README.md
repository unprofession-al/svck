## Install

### Binary Download

### From Source

Make sure you have [go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed, then run: 

```
# go get -u https://github.com/unprofession-al/svck
```

## How to use

Define a bunch of services you want to check (`website.yaml`):

```yaml
---
my_website:
  addresses:
    - "very.unprofession.al"
  tests:
    root_no_ssl: 
      ssl: false
      resources:
        root:
          url:          "/"
          content_type: "text/html"
      status: 302
    very_important_pages:
      ssl: true
      resources:
        index:
          url:          "/"
          content_type: "text/html"
          contains:
            - "<title(.*?)</title>"
            - class="(letter|number)"
        very_important:
          url:          "bla.html"
          content_type: "text/html"
      status: 200
```

Then, run `svck`:

```
svck run website.yaml
